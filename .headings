Heading: Your Ctrl+F is Garbage.
Subheading: Because your chats aren't a document, they're a headache. Piri indexes them. Search works now. Duh.

Heading: Stop Apologizing to Your Boss for Being Slow.
Subheading: "Sorry, scrolling." Pathetic. Piri indexes your AI convos. Find it fast. Look competent for once.

Heading: I Can’t Believe I Had to Build This. Subheading: OpenAI is worth 100 billion dollars and they couldn't give you a navigation bar? Embarrassing. Here. I fixed it. Now go work.


Heading: This Tool is for People Who Hate Themselves a Little Less.
Subheading: You clearly don't. You're still scrolling. Piri auto-indexes. Do better.
